# Create-the-own-radio-signal
The concept of this project is to **simulate an FM radio station** by generating and modulating an FM (Frequency Modulation) signal using Scilab. This involves several key components:

### 1. **FM Modulation**
   - FM modulation is a process where the frequency of a carrier wave (a high-frequency signal) is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of a lower-frequency message signal (in this case, audio).
   - **Carrier Signal**: A high-frequency sine wave that "carries" the information. For FM broadcasting, the carrier frequency is typically in the range of 88â€“108 MHz (though we are simulating this at a lower frequency).
   - **Message Signal**: The audio or information signal that we want to broadcast. It is usually a lower-frequency signal, such as music or voice (e.g., 500 Hz tone in this case).

### 2. **Message Signal (Audio Signal)**
   - The message signal is an audio signal, which can be a pre-recorded file or a generated waveform, like a sine wave. This signal is the content we want to broadcast on the FM channel.
   - In a real-world scenario, this could be music, a voice recording, or any other audio input.

### 3. **Resampling of the Audio Signal**
   - In order to apply FM modulation, the audio signal needs to be sampled at a higher frequency than the original audio signal. This ensures smooth modulation of the carrier signal at a higher carrier frequency. Resampling aligns the time scales of the audio signal and the modulated FM signal.

### 4. **Integration of the Audio Signal**
   - FM modulation requires the integration of the audio signal because the instantaneous frequency of the carrier is proportional to the derivative of the phase. This means the phase shift is determined by the integrated value of the audio signal.

### 5. **Generating the FM Signal**
   - The FM signal is generated by varying the frequency of the carrier signal based on the integrated message signal. The result is a carrier signal that "moves" in frequency according to the audio content.

### 6. **Spectrum Analysis (FFT)**
   - The project includes a spectrum analysis (via Fast Fourier Transform) of the generated FM signal. This allows you to visualize the frequency components of the modulated signal, showing how the carrier frequency shifts according to the audio signal's changes in amplitude.

### 7. **Playing the Audio Signal**
   - For validation, the original audio signal (not the modulated FM signal) can be played back using Scilab's `sound()` function. In a real-world setup, this is what you would hear when tuning into the modulated signal on a radio receiver.

### **Project Workflow**

1. **Audio Generation**: A simple audio signal (e.g., a sine wave) is generated, or you can load an external audio file (e.g., a `.wav` file with music or voice recording).
   
2. **Resampling**: The audio signal is resampled to match the higher sampling frequency required for FM modulation.

3. **FM Modulation**: The resampled audio signal is used to modulate the frequency of a high-frequency carrier wave. The carrier frequency is shifted based on the amplitude of the audio signal.

4. **Visualization**: The audio signal, the modulated FM signal, and the spectrum of the FM signal are visualized to better understand how the modulation process affects the signal.

5. **Sound Playback**: Optionally, you can play back the original audio signal to compare how it relates to the modulated FM signal.

### **Real-World Application**
In a real-world scenario, after generating the FM signal, you would broadcast it using radio transmission equipment. The main components for setting up a real FM radio station include:
- **FM Transmitter**: Converts the modulated signal to a high-frequency signal and sends it to the antenna.
- **Antenna**: Radiates the modulated FM signal into the airwaves for reception by FM receivers (radios).
- **FM Receiver**: Listeners can tune into the specific frequency using an FM radio, which demodulates the signal and reproduces the original audio.

### **Project Goals**
- Simulate the process of **FM modulation** in software.
- Provide **visual analysis** of how the message signal is embedded in the FM carrier.
- **Understand the basics** of radio communication systems, particularly FM broadcasting.
- Learn about **signal processing concepts** such as interpolation, modulation, integration, and frequency spectrum analysis.

### **Educational Benefits**
This project offers insights into key concepts of communication engineering:
- **Modulation Techniques**: Understanding how FM differs from other modulation types, such as AM (Amplitude Modulation).
- **Signal Processing**: Gain familiarity with interpolation, spectrum analysis, and the relationship between time-domain and frequency-domain representations of signals.
- **Practical Broadcasting**: Simulate a process that is used in real-world radio stations, giving a hands-on understanding of how radio systems work.
